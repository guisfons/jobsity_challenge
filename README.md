Hello everyone, this is the challenge project using WordPress, unfortunately it is not complete, due to technical problems I had with my laptop, I was only able to start developing the project on Sunday night, which was when I managed to fix it. If you need it and I can have another shot, I would be eternally grateful.

The project does not need to be installed directly on the machine, but if you want, just copy the project theme and place any WordPress in an instance and import the database that is attached to the "db" folder. Or after setting up a WordPress instance, install the "All-in-One WP Migration" plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/), and import the "wp-website.wpress" with the plugin

The project can be accessed through the URL "https://disnorte.dreamhosters.com/"
