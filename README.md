Hello everyone, thank you so much for the chance to improve the project!
If you want to send me another one focusing more on WordPress I'll gladly accept it, because I really want to step up in my career, learn more and of course be an addition to the team!
This challenge is using WordPress.

There are two things that I've could solve yet:
1) The scroll pagination without using the filters;
2) The date order of the movies related to the actor.

The project does not need to be installed directly on the machine (you can access it via 'https://moviemation.dreamhosters.com/'), but if you want, just copy the project theme and place any WordPress in an instance and import the file inside the "db" folder:
If you want to import natively using WordPress please select the "moviemation.WordPress.xml" file, but I higly recomend to install the "All-in-One WP Migration" plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/), and import the "wmoviemation.wpress" with the plugin
If you choose the second option, you will need to re sign up on the WP Dashboard, using this credencials:

##Dashboard Access:

Again, thank you all and I hope I can fit in your team!
